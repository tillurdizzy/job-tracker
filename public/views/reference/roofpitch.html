        <h2>All You Need to Know About Roof Pitch</h2>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Roof pitch describes the 'steepness' of a roof</li>
        <li>Pitch is important in determining the cost of replacement, as well as in choosing the correct materials</li>
        <li>Using pitch, you can quickly and accurately calculate a roof’s size and the amount of materials needed for installation. Most contractors and estimators use pitch as the primary way to calculate roof area.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What is roof pitch?</h3>

    <p>Roof pitch or slope is a measure of steepness or incline, represented in inches rise of 12 inches run. For example a '3 pitch' or '3 in 12 pitch' or '3/12 pitch', all mean that the roof rises 3 inches, for every 12 inches of it’s horizontal run.</p>
    <p>Using pitch, its footprint, and basic geometry, you can quickly and with a high degree of accuracy calculate the length of the gable sides. This will allow you to get very precise area measurements.</p>

    <h3>Calculating Pitch Using A Level and Measuring Tape</h3>
   
    <p>For this most accurate calculation, you will need a ladder, long enough to reach the roof edge, a 2 feet level, and a measuring tape. Use caution when climbing up the ladder, and do not go onto a roof without adequate fall protection. We also recommend using a ladder stabilizer to prevent it from sliding to the sides.</p>
    <p>Once you reach the top of the ladder, position your level so that one end touches the roof surface, while the other end is in the air, and it is leveled. Now, measure the distance between the roof surface straight down from the level’s opposite edge – refer to diagram below.</p>
    <p>Let’s assume we measured that the rise of the roof is 13 inches for every 24″ run. Therefore, it is 6.5″ over 12″ – well that is our roof pitch – 6.5 in 12.</p>

    <p>Roof pitch may also be expressed in degrees.</p>
