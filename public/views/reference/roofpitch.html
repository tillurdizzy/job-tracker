        <h2>All You Need to Know About Roof Pitch</h2>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Roof pitch describes the 'steepness' of a roof</li>
        <li>Pitch is important in determining the cost of replacement, as well as in choosing the correct materials</li>
        <li>Using pitch, you can quickly and accurately calculate a roof’s size and the amount of materials needed for installation. Most contractors and estimators use pitch as the primary way to calculate roof area.</li>

    <h3>What is roof pitch?</h3>

    <p>Roof pitch or slope is a measure of steepness or incline, represented in inches rise of 12 inches run. For example a “3 pitch” or “3 in 12 pitch” or “3/12 pitch”, all mean that the roof rises 3 inches, for every 12 inches of it’s horizontal run.</p>
    <p>Using pitch, its footprint, and basic geometry, you can quickly and with a high degree of accuracy calculate the length of the gable sides. This will allow you to get very precise area measurements.</p>
    <p>A roof can also be measured in degrees. However, it is often a difficult and an unnecessary way to estimate slope, while using pitch is simpler, faster, and often – more accurate. Nevertheless, our roof pitch calculator provides instant conversion from pitch to degrees and backwards.</p>
